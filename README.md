**TO DO : Follow the below framework to design System. Mandatory upload of hand drawn photos of design.**

**Capacity Estimation and Constraints**
<p>How will your system be able to handle huge traffic and handle the storage ? Make assumptions that are based on real life systems.</p>

**System APIs**

**Database Design**

**High Level System Design**

**Detailed Component Design**

**Data Partitioning Data Partitioning**
